						  I want to inform you that whenever you
						  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
						  I collect data and information (through third party
						  products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
						  include information such as your device Internet Protocol
						  (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
						  configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,

						  statistics.
						</p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
						  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
						  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
						  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
						  stored on your device's internal memory.

						  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

						  and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
						  choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
						  portions of this Service.
						</p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
						  I may employ third-party companies and
						  individuals due to the following reasons:
						</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
						  I want to inform users of this Service
						  that these third parties have access to your Personal
						  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
						  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
						  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
						</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
						  I value your trust in providing us your
						  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
						  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
						  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
						  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
						  guarantee its absolute security.

						  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
						  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
						  that these external sites are not operated by me.
						  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
						  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
						  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
						  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
						  services.

						  These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
						  I do not knowingly collect personally
						  identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
						  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
						  me with personal information, I immediately
						  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
						  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
						  personal information, please contact me so that
						  I will be able to do necessary actions.

						  I may update our Privacy Policy from
						  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
						  periodically for any changes. I will

    <body>
    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                  allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                  to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                  versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Vinted Bot.
                </p> <p>
                  Vinted Bot is committed to ensuring that the app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The Vinted Bot app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                  that the Vinted Bot app won’t work properly or at all.
                </p> <div><p>
                    The app does use third party services that declare their own
                    Terms and Conditions.
                  </p> <p>

                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Vinted Bot will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but Vinted Bot
                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Vinted Bot cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                  Vinted Bot cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Vinted Bot’s responsibility for your
                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Vinted Bot accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                  both systems(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. Vinted Bot does not promise that it
                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Terms and Conditions
                  from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                  Conditions on this page.
